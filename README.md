# DiviCrypt Description
DiviCrypt is a python written script which has the ability of obfsucating(encrypting), encoding and compiling to exe .py scripts.
It is very usefull when envading AVs! So far DiviCrypt can encode to base64 but we are planning on making a Xor encoding option.

# Requirements!
</p>
DiviCrypt was developed and test with python2 it will diffently not work with python3!
Since its for linux, the compiling option requires pyinstaller, pyinstaller if ran from a linux machine it will compile it to .elf though if you ran it from wine and install python then pyinstaller from wine you should be alright!
Here's a video which i followed to install pyinstaller with wine:
